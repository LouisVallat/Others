Sometimes I do a little project or a little program, but it doesn't deservea repo on its own so I put them here

## PROJECTS HERE:
### PokemonMoneyCalculator
Coded it for a little CTF at my IUT on the 19/01/2019.
When you play Pokemon, you earn money as you beat other pokemons. We had to calculate which pokemon had the maximum amount of money based on 10k records. The flag was the name of the pokemon who earned the maximum amount of money, and this amount, concatenated.
